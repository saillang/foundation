# Media

Note that all the media (since most of this will be temporary and replaced with unique art, hopefully) is in a special branch `media`.

## Regarding Logo/Branding

### from svgsilh

There are a bunch of examples in `media/svgsilh/`.  These are CC0 licensed via svgsilh, but need a more liberal license.  Either find a public domain image or ideally just hire someone to create a unique logo.

To find the original URL, take the number of the filename and use it in the URL as in the following examples:

- https://svgsilh.com/image/158062.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/309781.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/304361.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/3248805.html

## Other Media

There is other media in `/media/` arranged by license for any use (if any).
