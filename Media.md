# Media

Note that all the media (since most of this will be temporary and replaced with unique art, hopefully) is in a special branch `media`.

## Regarding Logo/Branding

### from svgsilh

There are a bunch of examples in `media/svgsilh/`.  These are CC0 licensed via svgsilh, but need a more liberal license.  Either find a public domain image or ideally just hire someone to create a unique logo.

To find the original URL, take the number of the filename and use it in the URL as in the following examples:

- https://svgsilh.com/image/158062.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/309781.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/304361.html
- https://svgsilh.com/image/3248805.html

### for purchase

- [canstockphoto boat/yacht](https://www.canstockphoto.com/boat-yacht-isolated-vector-icon-7838491.html)
- [red square logo](https://www.canstockphoto.com/boat-with-sails-icon-digital-red-50803286.html) (actually, this one is very nice, just needs relief and color change) 
  - and [similar/alternate version](https://www.canstockphoto.com/sail-boat-sign-37423315).

  - https://www.canstockphoto.com/boat-with-sails-icon-digital-blue-66463907.html <- write sail underneath this one and it would be spot on
